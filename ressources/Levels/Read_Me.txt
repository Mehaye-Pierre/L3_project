/* PLEASE READ THIS PART OR YOUR GRID MAY NOT BE PLAYABLE *\
- Grids are only 9x9
- Line separators aren't read... You can write your grid in several lines. (Until no space is written on an empty line)
- The final string length is 9x9 = 81.
- If you write any space or character before, behind or in your grid, the grid won't be playable and the game may raise an exception (and crash).
