/***** TUTORIAL *****\
- Create a file (without extension)
- Name it without special characters : "-" and "_" are tolerated.
  Only 0-9, a-z and A-Z and "-" and "_"
- Insert your cells in the file this way :
    - 0 is a boardgame cell (No pawn can be placed on this cell)
    - 1 is an empty cell
    - 2 is a pawn of color 1
    - 3 is a pawn of color 2
- Save and exit
\********************/

/* PLEASE READ THIS PART OR YOUR GRID MAY NOT BE PLAYABLE *\
- Grids are only 9x9
- You must fill your file in one line (each lines are stuck on the first line of the file)
- The final string length is 9x9 = 81.
- If you write any space or character before, behind or in your grid, the grid won't be playable and the game may raise an exception (and crash).
